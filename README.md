# gif.js

JavaScript .GIF encoder that runs in your browser.

Uses typed arrays and web workers to render each frame in the background, it's really fast!

**Demo** - http://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js/

Works in browsers supporting: [Web Workers](http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/), [File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) and [Typed Arrays](https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/)

Tested in
  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox 17
  * Safari 6
  * Internet Explorer 10
  * Mobile Safari iOS 6

## Usage

Include `gif.js` found in `dist/` in your page. Also make sure to have `gif.worker.js` in the same location.

```javascript
var gif = new GIF({
  workers: 2,
  quality: 10
});

// add an image element
gif.addFrame(imageElement);

// or a canvas element
gif.addFrame(canvasElement, {delay: 200});

// or copy the pixels from a canvas context
gif.addFrame(ctx, {copy: true});

gif.on('finished', function(blob) {
  window.open(URL.createObjectURL(blob));
});

gif.render();
```

## Options

Options can be passed to the constructor or using the `setOptions` method.

| Name         | Default         | Description                                        |
| -------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| repeat       | `0`             | repeat count, `-1` = no repeat, `0` = forever      |
| quality      | `10`            | pixel sample interval, lower is better             |
| workers      | `2`             | number of web workers to spawn                     |
| workerScript | `gif.worker.js` | url to load worker script from                     |
| background   | `#fff`          | background color where source image is transparent |
| width        | `null`          | output image width                                 |
| height       | `null`          | output image height                                |
| transparent  | `null`          | transparent hex color, `0x00FF00` = green          |
